Create a web service that consumes two separate streams of increasing
integers and can be queried to return the next element of the "merged"
list, maintaining increasing order. (In place of "A" and "B" below, please
use the given stream keys.)


For example, if successive calls to streams "A" and "B" produce:



         Stream      1st call 2nd call  3rd call

         "A"         2        3         8

         "B"         4        5         6



then calls to your service should yield:



         1st call   2nd call 3rd call  4th call  5th call 6th call

         2          3        4         5         6        8




Streams "A" & "B" may be retrieved by making GET requests to

        https://api.datasource.com/next/A
        https://api.datasource.com/next/B

where each response is a JSON payload formatted like so:

        {
                 "last": <the stream's last value>,
                 "current": <the stream's current value>,
                 "stream": <the stream's name>
        }


We should be able to query your server at

        /quiz/merge?stream1=A&stream2=B

and responses should be formatted like so (e.g., the second call above):

        {
                 "last": 2,
                 "current": 3
        }


You may use a web framework of your choice, and do not need to actually
deploy the server. Just send over your code and some brief instructions
so we can get it up and running locally.
